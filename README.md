### Introduction

Website used for Equalizing audios (reducing and increasing specific audios according to the chosen mode of operation) through Signal Processing.

### Main Idea

We process the signal by scaling a range of frequencies based on **Decibel scale** after applying **Fast Fourier Transfrom** on the audio uploaded, After the changes we invert the changed frequencies back to Time Domain then convert it back into audio format.

### Features
- Optimized software & fast processing speed
- Clean audio reconstruction
- #### Live dynamic plotting

- Live updates on spectrogram
- 4 Working modes (Basic - Vowels - Animals - Muscial Instruments)

### Run The project

You need to install
- Python
- Streamlit --> pip install streamlit
- Matplotlib --> pip install matplotlib
- Pandas --> pip install pandas
- Numpy --> pip install numpy
- Scipy --> pip install scipy
- Altair --> pip install altair
- streamlit.components.v1 --> pip install streamlit.components.v1

Then use command *streamlit run main.py* in the terminal
