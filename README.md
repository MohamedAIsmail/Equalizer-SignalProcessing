### Introduction

- Website used for Equalizing audios (reducing and increasing specific audios according to the chosen mode of operation) through Signal Processing.

### Brief Explanation

- We process the signal by scaling a range of frequencies based on **Decibel scale** after applying **Fast Fourier Transfrom** on the audio uploaded, After the changes we invert the changed frequencies back to Time Domain then convert it back into audio format.

- Our application works in different modes such as:
   - Uniform Range Mode: The sampling frequency of the input audio (44.1k Hz) we divide it by 2 to get the maximum frequency then divide it uniformly into 8 equal ranges of frequencies, each is controlled by one slider in the UI.
   - Vowels Mode: Each slider can control the magnitude of specific vowel.
   - Musical Instruments Mode: Each slider can control the power of a specific musical instrument.
   - Animals Mode: Each slider can control the magnitude of a specific animal sound.
